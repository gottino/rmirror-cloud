# GitHub Actions Deployment Guide

This guide walks you through setting up automated deployment to your Hetzner production server using GitHub Actions.

## Overview

When you push code to the `main` branch (or manually trigger a deployment), GitHub Actions will:
1. Connect to your Hetzner server via SSH
2. Pull the latest code
3. Install dependencies
4. Run database migrations
5. Run tests
6. Restart the application
7. Perform health checks

## Prerequisites

- [x] GitHub repository with your code
- [x] Hetzner server with SSH access
- [x] `deploy` user on the server with sudo privileges
- [x] Deployment scripts in place (`backend/scripts/deploy.sh`)

## Step 1: Generate SSH Key for GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions needs to connect to your server via SSH. Generate a dedicated SSH key pair for this:

```bash
# On your local machine
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "github-actions@rmirror" -f ~/.ssh/github_actions_rmirror

# This creates two files:
# - ~/.ssh/github_actions_rmirror (private key - keep secret!)
# - ~/.ssh/github_actions_rmirror.pub (public key)
```

**Important**: Use a strong passphrase or leave it empty for automated deployments.

## Step 2: Add Public Key to Server

Copy the **public key** to your server so GitHub Actions can authenticate:

```bash
# Copy public key to clipboard (macOS)
cat ~/.ssh/github_actions_rmirror.pub | pbcopy

# Or display it
cat ~/.ssh/github_actions_rmirror.pub
```

Then add it to your server's authorized_keys:

```bash
# SSH into your server
ssh deploy@167.235.74.51

# Add the public key
echo "YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

# Set correct permissions
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 700 ~/.ssh

# Exit
exit
```

**Test the connection** from your local machine:

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/github_actions_rmirror deploy@167.235.74.51 "echo 'Connection successful!'"
```

## Step 3: Store Secrets in GitHub

GitHub Actions needs your private SSH key and server details. Store them as **encrypted secrets**.

### 3.1 Navigate to Repository Settings

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click **Settings** (top right)
3. In the left sidebar, click **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
4. Click **New repository secret**

### 3.2 Add the Following Secrets

Create these secrets one by one:

| Secret Name | Description | How to Get Value |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` | GitHub Actions SSH key | `cat ~/.ssh/github_actions_rmirror` |
| `SERVER_HOST` | Production server IP | Your Hetzner IP (e.g., `167.235.74.51`) |
| `SERVER_USER` | SSH user for deployment | `deploy` |
| `SERVER_PORT` | SSH port | `22` (default) |

**Adding SSH_PRIVATE_KEY:**

```bash
# Display private key (macOS/Linux)
cat ~/.ssh/github_actions_rmirror

# Copy the ENTIRE output including:
# -----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
# ...key content...
# -----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
```

Paste this into GitHub as the `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` secret.

**Security Notes:**
- ✅ Never commit private keys to git
- ✅ GitHub encrypts all secrets
- ✅ Secrets are only accessible in GitHub Actions workflows
- ✅ Use dedicated keys for CI/CD (easier to rotate)

## Step 4: Create GitHub Actions Workflow

Create the workflow file that defines your deployment pipeline:

```bash
# On your local machine, in the project root
mkdir -p .github/workflows
```

Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

```yaml
name: Deploy to Production

on:
  # Trigger on push to main branch
  push:
    branches:
      - main
    paths:
      - 'backend/**'
      - '.github/workflows/deploy.yml'

  # Allow manual deployment from GitHub UI
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      branch:
        description: 'Branch to deploy'
        required: false
        default: 'main'

jobs:
  deploy:
    name: Deploy to Hetzner
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup SSH
        run: |
          mkdir -p ~/.ssh
          echo "${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}" > ~/.ssh/deploy_key
          chmod 600 ~/.ssh/deploy_key

          # Add server to known_hosts to avoid prompt
          ssh-keyscan -p ${{ secrets.SERVER_PORT }} ${{ secrets.SERVER_HOST }} >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts

      - name: Deploy to server
        env:
          SERVER_HOST: ${{ secrets.SERVER_HOST }}
          SERVER_USER: ${{ secrets.SERVER_USER }}
          SERVER_PORT: ${{ secrets.SERVER_PORT }}
          BRANCH: ${{ github.event.inputs.branch || 'main' }}
        run: |
          ssh -i ~/.ssh/deploy_key \
              -p $SERVER_PORT \
              $SERVER_USER@$SERVER_HOST \
              "cd /var/www/rmirror-cloud && ./backend/scripts/deploy.sh $BRANCH"

      - name: Check deployment status
        if: success()
        run: |
          echo "✅ Deployment successful!"
          echo "🔍 Check status: ssh ${{ secrets.SERVER_USER }}@${{ secrets.SERVER_HOST }} 'sudo systemctl status rmirror'"

      - name: Deployment failed
        if: failure()
        run: |
          echo "❌ Deployment failed! Check the logs above."
          echo "📊 Server logs: ssh ${{ secrets.SERVER_USER }}@${{ secrets.SERVER_HOST }} 'sudo journalctl -u rmirror -n 50'"

      - name: Cleanup
        if: always()
        run: |
          rm -f ~/.ssh/deploy_key
```

## Step 5: Commit and Push Workflow

```bash
# Add the workflow file
git add .github/workflows/deploy.yml

# Commit (following your commit guidelines - no personal info!)
git commit -m "feat: add GitHub Actions deployment workflow

Automated deployment pipeline for production server.

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

## Step 6: Monitor First Deployment

### 6.1 Watch the Workflow Run

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click the **Actions** tab
3. You should see "Deploy to Production" running
4. Click on the workflow run to see live logs

### 6.2 Workflow Stages

The deployment will go through these stages:
1. ✅ **Checkout code**: Clone your repository
2. ✅ **Setup SSH**: Configure SSH authentication
3. ✅ **Deploy to server**: Run deployment script on server
4. ✅ **Check deployment status**: Verify success

### 6.3 What Happens on the Server

The `deploy.sh` script will:
1. Backup database
2. Pull latest code from git
3. Install dependencies (poetry)
4. Run database migrations (alembic)
5. Run tests (pytest)
6. Restart application (systemd)
7. Health check (curl to /health)

## Step 7: Manual Deployment (Optional)

You can also trigger deployments manually:

1. Go to **Actions** tab on GitHub
2. Select "Deploy to Production" workflow
3. Click **Run workflow** button
4. Choose branch (default: main)
5. Click **Run workflow**

## Troubleshooting

### SSH Connection Issues

**Problem**: `Permission denied (publickey)`

**Solution**:
```bash
# Verify public key is on server
ssh deploy@167.235.74.51 "cat ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"

# Test SSH key locally
ssh -i ~/.ssh/github_actions_rmirror deploy@167.235.74.51 "echo 'Test'"
```

### Secret Not Found

**Problem**: `Error: Secret SSH_PRIVATE_KEY not found`

**Solution**:
- Go to **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
- Verify all secrets are created with exact names (case-sensitive)
- Re-create the secret if needed

### Deployment Script Fails

**Problem**: Tests fail, migrations fail, or service won't start

**Solution**:
```bash
# SSH into server manually
ssh deploy@167.235.74.51

# Check what went wrong
cd /var/www/rmirror-cloud/backend
sudo journalctl -u rmirror -n 100

# Check recent deployments
ls -lah /var/backups/rmirror/
```

### Workflow Doesn't Trigger

**Problem**: Pushed to main but workflow didn't run

**Solutions**:
- Check if you modified files in `backend/**` (workflow filters by path)
- Go to **Actions** tab and check if workflows are enabled
- Check **Settings** → **Actions** → **General** - ensure workflows are allowed

### Known Hosts Error

**Problem**: `Host key verification failed`

**Solution**: The workflow includes `ssh-keyscan` to automatically trust your server. If it still fails:
```yaml
# Add to deploy step in workflow:
run: |
  ssh -i ~/.ssh/deploy_key \
      -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no \  # Skip host verification
      -p $SERVER_PORT \
      $SERVER_USER@$SERVER_HOST \
      "cd /var/www/rmirror-cloud && ./backend/scripts/deploy.sh"
```

## Advanced: Deploy to Staging First

For safer deployments, add a staging environment:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml
name: Deploy to Staging

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - develop

jobs:
  deploy:
    # ... same as production but with different secrets:
    # STAGING_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY
    # STAGING_SERVER_HOST
    # STAGING_SERVER_USER
```

## Advanced: Deployment Notifications

Get notified when deployments complete:

```yaml
# Add to deploy.yml after deployment step
- name: Notify deployment success
  if: success()
  run: |
    # Add Slack, Discord, or email notification here
    echo "Deployment successful!"

- name: Notify deployment failure
  if: failure()
  run: |
    echo "Deployment failed! Check logs."
```

## Security Best Practices

1. ✅ **Use dedicated SSH keys** for GitHub Actions (not your personal key)
2. ✅ **Limit key permissions** - deploy user should have minimal privileges
3. ✅ **Rotate keys regularly** - update keys every 90 days
4. ✅ **Use branch protection** - require PR reviews before merging to main
5. ✅ **Monitor deployments** - check GitHub Actions logs regularly
6. ✅ **Never commit secrets** - always use GitHub Secrets

## Monitoring Deployments

### View Recent Deployments

```bash
# On GitHub
Actions tab → Deploy to Production → Click any run

# On server
ssh deploy@167.235.74.51 "sudo journalctl -u rmirror -n 50"
```

### Rollback a Deployment

If a deployment breaks something:

```bash
# SSH to server
ssh deploy@167.235.74.51

cd /var/www/rmirror-cloud/backend

# Find the previous working commit
git log --oneline -n 10

# Rollback to that commit
git checkout <commit-hash>
./scripts/deploy.sh

# Or restore database backup
ls -lah /var/backups/rmirror/
```

## Next Steps

- [ ] Test the deployment workflow with a small change
- [ ] Set up branch protection rules on GitHub
- [ ] Configure deployment notifications
- [ ] Create a staging environment
- [ ] Document rollback procedures
- [ ] Set up monitoring/alerting for production

## Questions?

If something doesn't work:
1. Check GitHub Actions logs (Actions tab)
2. Check server logs (`ssh deploy@167.235.74.51 'sudo journalctl -u rmirror -n 100'`)
3. Verify all secrets are set correctly
4. Test SSH connection manually
